Disabling Specific Protocols in Windows builds
The configure utility, unfortunately, is not available for the Windows environment, therefore, you cannot use the various disable-protocol options of the configure utility on this platform.

However, you can use the following defines to disable specific protocols:

HTTP_ONLY disables all protocols except HTTP
CURL_DISABLE_FTP disables FTP
CURL_DISABLE_LDAP disables LDAP
CURL_DISABLE_TELNET disables TELNET
CURL_DISABLE_DICT disables DICT
CURL_DISABLE_FILE disables FILE
CURL_DISABLE_TFTP disables TFTP
CURL_DISABLE_HTTP disables HTTP
CURL_DISABLE_IMAP disables IMAP
CURL_DISABLE_POP3 disables POP3
CURL_DISABLE_SMTP disables SMTP
If you want to set any of these defines you have the following options:

Modify lib/config-win32.h
Modify lib/curl_setup.h
Modify winbuild/Makefile.vc
Modify the "Preprocessor Definitions" in the libcurl project
Note: The pre-processor settings can be found using the Visual Studio IDE under "Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> General" in VC6 and "Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor" in later versions.
